rfmix-reader
============

`rfmix-reader` is a Python package designed to efficiently read and process 
output files generated by RFMix, a popular tool for estimating local ancestry in 
admixed populations. The package employs a lazy loading approach, which minimizes 
memory consumption by reading only the loci that are accessed by the user, rather 
than loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
