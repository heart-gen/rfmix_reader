Welcome to rfmix-reader's documentation!
========================================

`rfmix-reader` is a Python package designed to efficiently read and process
output files generated by RFMix, a popular tool for estimating local ancestry in
admixed populations. The package employs a lazy loading approach, which minimizes
memory consumption by reading only the loci that are accessed by the user, rather
than loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
