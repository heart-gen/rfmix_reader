description = "RFMix-reader is a Python package designed to efficiently read and process output files generated by RFMix, a popular tool for estimating local ancestry in admixed populations. The package employs a lazy loading approach, which minimizes memory consumption by reading only the loci that are accessed by the user, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once."
